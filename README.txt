README.txt
This is a repository for my comp20 class work and future web aplication projects. 
My favorite project was duckhunt except I really want to make it into an actual game.
For a joke I also really enjoyed the omfgdogs project.

I think I have grown in my knowledge and understanding of how the different pieces of the 
internet work together. I feel confident in my ability to tackle the problems and projects 
that are thrown at me. This is mostly do to the fact that if I find myself doing/working
with something I have not used before, I can read and understand the documentation for it.
